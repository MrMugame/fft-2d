# FFT-2D
This is a collection of implementations of a 2d FFT. It laods a pgm Image does a Fast Fourier Transform and saves it back to a pgm. My goal is to just steadily add languages and maybe reach a big collection at some point.
The implementation is not perfect and could probably be made faster and a lot more beatiful in some languages but Im just not good enough at most of the languages to do so.
## Building
Every example has a build file for linux:
``` bash
./build.sh && ./build/fft
```
